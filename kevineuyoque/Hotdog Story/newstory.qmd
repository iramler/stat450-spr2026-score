The Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest began in 1972 in Brooklyn, New York.
Over time, rules, competitors, and performance levels have changed.


This module uses closeread to tell a data story through scrolling.
How closeread works:

- Give each plot a target ID like {#cr-plotname}

- Reference the plot in narrative text using @cr-plotname

- As the reader scrolls to the reference, that plot becomes the focus

- A strong closeread story typically follows a pattern:
(1) establish a baseline → 2. notice a pattern → 3. test an explanation with a better metric.

Step 1 — Total hot dogs over time (men) @cr-total-dogs-by-year

Let’s begin with the simplest view, the total number of hot dogs eaten by the men’s winner each year.

Prompt: Why might totals be misleading for comparing across years?

:::{#cr-total-dogs-by-year}

```{r}
ggplot(hotdog_men, aes(x = Year, y = Dogs)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Men: Total Hot Dogs Eaten by Year",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Total Hot Dogs (Winner)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

:::

Viewing the plot there is a massive spike that can be seen between the years 2000 and 2001. Why does this happen?

This jump is worth investigating. Next, we need to check whether this is a real performance shift or a measurement issue.Look into what occured during the 2001 contest



Step 2 — Standardize performance: hot dogs per minute @cr-rate-hist-men

To compare winners across time, we standardize performance by using:
Hot dogs per minute = Dogs ÷ Time

A histogram shows the overall distribution of men’s winners’ rates. @cr-rate-hist-men

:::{#cr-rate-hist-men}

```{r}
ggplot(hotdog_men, aes(x = Hotdogs_per_minute)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 12) +
  labs(title = "Men’s Winners: Hot Dogs Per Minute",
    x = "Hot Dogs per Minute",
    y = "Count of Years") +
  theme_minimal()

```
:::

Step 3 — Eating rate over time (men) @cr-rate-by-year-men

Now track hot dogs per minute across years to see long-run changes. @cr-rate-by-year-men

:::{#cr-rate-by-year-men}


```{r}
ggplot(hotdog_men, aes(x = Year, y = Hotdogs_per_minute)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Men: Hot Dogs Per Minute by Year",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Hot Dogs per Minute") +
  theme_minimal()
```
:::

Step 4 — Smoothed trend (men) @cr-rate-smooth-men

A smoother can make the overall pattern easier to see. @cr-rate-smooth-men

:::{#cr-rate-smooth-men}

```{r}
ggplot(hotdog_men, aes(x = Year, y = Hotdogs_per_minute)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Men: Smoothed Trend in Hot Dogs per Minute",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Hot Dogs per Minute") +
  theme_minimal()
```
:::

Step 5 — Joey Chestnut’s era (men) @cr-joey

To end the story, we highlight one competitor to show how an individual can define an era. @cr-joey

:::{#cr-joey}

```{r}
joey_wins <- hotdog_men |> filter(Winner == "Joey Chestnut")

ggplot(hotdog_men, aes(x = Year, y = Hotdogs_per_minute)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "grey") +
  geom_point(data = joey_wins, size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Joey Chestnut’s Era Highlighted") +
  theme_minimal()
```
:::

The highlighted points represent Joey Chestnut’s winning years.
Notice how they cluster at the higher end of the graph

This shows that the modern era is not defined by a single spike, but by sustained high performance.

By isolating one competitor within the same anchor plot, the narrative shifts from a general trend to a clearly defined era.

# Now after going over the men's why dont you look into the women's following a similar structure
