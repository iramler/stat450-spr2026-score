## Introduction

The Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest has been held annually since 1972. Over time, changes in contest duration, training methods, and competitive intensity have shaped modern performance levels.

In this module, students explore contest data through a **closeread scrollytelling format** in Quarto. The goal is not only to analyze performance trends, but to understand how data visualization can be structured into a guided narrative.

Rather than simply presenting graphs, this activity emphasizes:

- Establishing a baseline
- Identifying structural shifts
- Testing explanations with better metrics

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

1. Interpret time series visualizations of competitive performance.
2. Distinguish between total counts and standardized rates (ex, hot dogs per minute).
3. Identify structural shifts in long term trends.
4. Use closeread in Quarto to create scrollytelling visualizations.
