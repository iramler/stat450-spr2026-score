#### Closeread essentials

Closeread adds one key idea to a normal Quarto document:

- A plot becomes a target when it has an ID like {#cr-plotname}

- Your narrative becomes a trigger when it references the target using @cr-plotname

- When the reader scrolls to that trigger, the plot becomes the focus

- You will see the same dataset multiple times. This is intentional, scrollytelling uses one anchor visualization and changes it slightly as the story advances.

Step 1 — Establish an anchor plot @cr-anchor

Create one plot that the reader can return to throughout the story.
This “anchor plot” should be simple and readable. It does not need heavy styling.

Here, the anchor shows men’s winner performance over time, measured as hot dogs per minute. @cr-anchor

:::{#cr-anchor}

```{r}
#| label: anchor
ggplot(hotdog_men, aes(x = Year, y = Hotdogs_per_minute)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Men: Winners’ Eating Rates Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Hot Dogs per Minute") +
  theme_minimal()
```

:::

Locate years that look unusually high compared to nearby years.


Step 2 — Teach a storytelling transition: totals vs rates @cr-totals

Instructional goal: Show how to justify a metric choice.
A common storytelling move is: start with the obvious metric (totals) and then explain why you switch to a fairer metric (rates).

This plot shows total hot dogs eaten by the men’s winner each year. @cr-totals
