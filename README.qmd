# Course Syllabus

## Course Description
[Back to top](#sye-seminar-on-score-modules)

In this SYE Seminar, you will use the learning-by-teaching approach by building educational materials (modules) for the SCORE Network. The modules use sports applications involving real-world problems and applications to further improve statistics and data science education. Module construction builds students’ statistical thinking, communication, and teaching & research skills.

## Course Expectations
[Back to top](#sye-seminar-on-score-modules)

This seminar is structured as a collaborative learning environment. Students are expected to participate actively in discussions, workdays, and peer-review sessions, and to approach both their own work and their classmates’ work with intellectual curiosity and professionalism. Because SCORE modules are designed for broader audiences, all work should reflect professional standards: clear writing, accurate statistical reasoning, reproducible code, appropriate data citation, and respectful engagement with feedback. Meeting deadlines, communicating proactively about challenges, and contributing meaningfully to peer review are considered core responsibilities of the course. Failure to meet these baseline expectations may affect the final course grade, regardless of the number of modules completed.

## Approximate Grade Expectations
[Back to top](#sye-seminar-on-score-modules)

| Grade Level | Description of Expected Work |
|---|---|
| **A (≈ 4.0)** | Completion of **three or more** high-quality SCORE modules, at least one of which is submission-ready for the public repository. Each module is reproducible, well-written, and pedagogically sound. At least one module must utilize a “new to you” statistical method. Consistent, insightful participation in peer review and discussions. Final reflection demonstrates depth, professionalism, and clear growth as a communicator. Presenting at the Festival of Science, Scholarship, and Creativity is also required. |
| **B (≈ 3.0)** | Completion of **two** full modules that meet SCORE expectations for clarity, accuracy, and reproducibility. Regular participation in class activities and peer review. Final reflection shows solid engagement and awareness of areas for continued development. Presenting at the Festival of Science, Scholarship, and Creativity is also required. |
| **C (≈ 2.0)** | Completion of **at least one** full module and an additional partial or exploratory project. Work demonstrates effort but may lack polish, depth, or consistent reproducibility. Participation and reflection are present but limited. |
| **Below C (< 2.0)** | Fewer than two modules produced, minimal participation, or failure to meet core expectations for professionalism, reproducibility, or integrity. |

## Participation Expectations
[Back to top](#sye-seminar-on-score-modules)

Students are expected to be present both physically and mentally for class meeting times. We will typically use class periods to make progress on modules, provide feedback to classmates, and provide updates to the group on progress. If you need to miss class due to illness or other legitimate reasons, please email me in advance.

You will also be expected to regularly meet with me one-on-one throughout the semester. In these meetings you will receive more specific feedback to your individual projects. It will also allow us to have discussions on what progress you should continue to make to achieve your goals for the seminar.

## Important Dates

# Making Modules

## General Workflow for Creating Modules
[Back to top](#sye-seminar-on-score-modules)

We are currently using the following workflow to create materials.

1.  Idea formation

    -   Choose either a sport or phenomenon of interest to investigate

2.  Data acquisition

    -   Find an existing data set (e.g., on Kaggle or from publiushed research articles) or webpages that can be scraped

    -   Clean the data to structure it in a way such that it can address your phenomenon of interest

3.  Data exploration

    -   Play with the data with several statistical methods (graphics, models, etc.) to get a better feel for your data and what is feasible with it

4.  Data Repository

    -   Prepare a submission for the data repository. After you move to the next step, a faculty mentor will review the file(s) and submit it to the [SCORE Network Data Repo](https://data.scorenetwork.org/){target="_blank"} for you.

5.  Worksheets

    -   Create a series of related questions to serve as the main materials for your module. For topics that you have already learned, you should model these off of either previously completed modules based on similar statistical topics or from an example given to you by a faculty mentor. 
    -   Create details solutions for these. (Tip: Do the solutions as you are writing the questions.)
    

6.  Module Quarto File

    -   Create the accompanying index.qmd file that contains all the background information related to your module. Use preexisting examples to help with this.
    
7. Additional Background

    - For at least one module, you will need to provide sufficient details on the statistical method used in the module. As an example (about a stat topic you likely already know) see: <https://modules.scorenetwork.org/golf/pga_masters_nor/> 

8.  Ready for Student Review

    -   Find a fellow student that is at similar stage and ask them to review your entire module. This includes working through the worksheet(s). Be sure to reciprocate by reviewing for someone else too.

9.  Ready for Faculty Review

    -  A faculty mentor will review your draft module and provide feedback as needed.

10.  Submitted to SLU SCORE Preprint server

11. Submitted to the [SCORE Network](https://scorenetwork.org/submissions.html){target="_blank"}

## Picking a Topic
[Back to top](#sye-seminar-on-score-modules)


For many people, player/team performance statistics is an easy way to start. However, it isn't the only type of data that we can use. The Network would be very interested in modules that expand on the type of data that is used. For example,

1. Athlete Health, Injury, and Load Management

Core idea: Performance is constrained by health; sports decisions increasingly rely on medical and biomechanical data.

2. Psychology, Decision-Making, and Mental Performance

Core idea: Psychological factors influence outcomes even when physical skill is held constant.

3. Fatigue, Recovery, and Scheduling Effects

Core idea: When and how athletes play matters as much as how well they play.

4. Officiating, Rules, and Fairness

Core idea: Sports systems are shaped by human and institutional decisions.

5. Equity, Access, and Structural Issues in Sports

Core idea: Sports data can illuminate systemic inequalities.


6. Revenue, Demand, and Fan Economics

Core idea: Teams and leagues are businesses operating in competitive markets.

## What if I don't really like sports?
[Back to top](#sye-seminar-on-score-modules)

There are a number of *sports-like* applications that you can do rather than strictly sports-focused. 

### Example sports-adjacent module themes

#### 1. Games, esports, and competitive play

Projects based on games are often the easiest conceptual translation for students.

**Examples**
- Online chess games (e.g., blitz vs rapid performance)
- Speedrunning data (variance in completion times)
- Casual competitive games (Tetris, Mario Kart, rhythm games)

#### 2. Board games and strategy games

These projects emphasize strategy, randomness, and repeated trials.

**Examples**
- Settlers of Catan (starting position and win rate)
- Card game tournaments (deck archetype success)
- Tabletop combat simulations

#### 3. Reality TV and judged competitions

Judged competitions provide rich structure and can be highly engaging for non-sports students.

**Examples**
- Baking competition shows
- Talent or performance-based elimination shows
- Survival-style competitions

#### 4. Fitness, movement, and wearables

These modules focus on individual performance rather than competition, but still support meaningful comparative analysis.

**Examples**
- Step counts or activity minutes
- Walking or cycling pace comparisons
- Heart rate or sleep-stage summaries


#### 5. Academic and knowledge-based competitions

These domains mirror team sports surprisingly well: repeated events, rankings, and depth vs “star” effects.

**Examples**
- Quiz Bowl or Science Olympiad
- Math or coding competitions
- Spelling Bee progression

#### 6. Arts, performance, and aesthetic competition

These modules highlight subjectivity, scoring consistency, and evaluation design.

**Examples**
- Dance or music competition scoring
- Marching band or ensemble evaluations
- Artistic judging rubrics
