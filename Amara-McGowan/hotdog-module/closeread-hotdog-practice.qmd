To highlight lines of code, you can either use a series of line numbers separated by commas or a range separate by a hyphen. Some examples:

- `highlight="1,5"`: highlight lines 1 and 5
- `highlight="1-5"`: highlight lines 1 through 5

The following section demonstrates that functionality. Note that all stickies use `.scale-to-fill`

:::{.cr-section}
Some text here. [@cr-dplyr]

In the first two lines we load the `readr` package and the `tidyverse` package, which will help us read in the data and interact with it. [@cr-dplyr]{highlight="1,2"}

Some text here. [@cr-dplyr]

This block of code shows us reading our data in, first as a dataset of all winners, but then separating winners by gender. `|>`. [@cr-dplyr]{highlight="4-6"}

:::{#cr-dplyr .scale-to-fill}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false

library(readr)
library(tidyverse)

hotdog_clean <- read_csv("C:/Users/14255/OneDrive/Desktop/GitHub Repos/stat450-spr2026-score/hotdogs/hotdog_clean.csv")
hotdog_men <- hotdog_clean |> filter(Sex == 1)
hotdog_women <- hotdog_clean |> filter(Sex == 0)
```
