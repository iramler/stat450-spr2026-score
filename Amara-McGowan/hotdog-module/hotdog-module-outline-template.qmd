### Introduction

League of Legends (LoL) is a 5 v. 5 multiplayer online battle arena
(MOBA) game developed by Riot Games. In this game, players assume the
role of a "champion" with unique abilities and engage in intense battles
against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions.

In standard play on Summoner's Rift, champions are typically assigned to
roles that correspond to different lanes/positions on the map—most
commonly Top, Jungle, Mid, Bottom (AD Carry), and Support (see
@fig-srmap). Champions assigned to each position have distinct strategic
responsibilities (for example, the Jungler moves between lanes to secure
objectives, while the Support focuses on protecting and enabling
teammates). Champions also have narrative identities that include
attributes such as gender, and players often choose champions based on a
mix of gameplay fit (role/position) and character preference.

![Lanes in Summoner's Rift](sr_map.png){#fig-srmap}

In this module, we will investigate whether the distribution of genders
differs across roles.

The majority of the champion metadata for this module comes from
[LoLdleData](https://github.com/Kerrders/LoLdleData){target="_blank"},
an open GitHub project that programmatically compiles "extra" champion
attributes that aren't conveniently available from the official Riot API
endpoints (e.g., gender, game lore region, and release year).

The LoLdleData is supplemented with laning information taken from the
fan-site [Mobalytics](https://mobalytics.gg/lol){target="_blank"} (based
on patch 16.2).

Because these are community-maintained, derived datasets, the gender and
lane labels should be treated as typical classifications rather than
official ground truth. In particular, lane/role assignments reflect a
snapshot based on patch 16.2, and many champions can be played
effectively in multiple lanes depending on strategy, player skill, and
balance changes.

By the end of this tutorial, students will be able to:

1.  Organize two categorical variables into a contingency table and
    compute row/column proportions.

2.  Create and interpret exploratory visualizations for two categorical
    variables (e.g., side-by-side bars, stacked proportion bars, mosaic
    plots).

3.  State hypotheses for the Chi-square test of association and explain
    what "independence" means in this context.

4.  Compute and interpret the Chi-square test statistic, degrees of
    freedom, and p-value using R.

5.  Check chi-square conditions by examining expected cell counts.

6.  Report and interpret an effect size for association.

7.  Use residuals / cell contributions to identify which category
    combinations drive the association.

**Technology Requirement:**

This activity is designed to be completed primarily in `R` using a
Quarto document workflow. Students should be comfortable importing data
and performing basic data wrangling with packages from the tidyverse
(especially `readr`, `dplyr`, and `tidyr`).

Statistical inference will be carried out using base R functions such as
`chisq.test()`.

We will also use the `vcd` package (Visualizing Categorical Data) to
create mosaic and association plots, including optional residual-based
shading that helps identify which category combinations contribute most
to the chi-square result.

<summary><b>Instructor’s Note (Optional: Point-and-Click
Software)</b></summary>

A short optional section provides guidance for completing the chi-square
test in a point-and-click environment (e.g., Minitab) for instructors
that do not use `R`.

### Data

The `lol_gender_lanes_patch16.2.csv` dataset contains 172 rows, one per
League of Legends champion, and includes basic metadata used to study
the relationship between **champion gender** and **typical lane/role**
(based on patch 16.2). Several metadata fields are included for context
and potential extensions, but the primary variables for this module are
`gender` and `lane`.

<summary><b>Variable Descriptions</b></summary>

| Variable | Description |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|

## Analyzing Associations between Categorical Variables

### Motivating question

In this module, we investigate the following research question:

> **Is champion gender associated with typical lane/role in League of
> Legends?**

> In other words, **does the distribution of champion genders differ
> across the five Summoner's Rift roles** (Top, Jungle, Mid, Bottom/AD
> Carry, Support)?

### Prepping Workspace

To begin, we will need to load the packages we will be using. For this analysis, you'll need to load the `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `vcd` packages.

<details>
<summary><b>Click to reveal code</b></summary>

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# If you need to install any of these uncomment the line below
# install.packages(c("dplyr,"tidyr", "vcd"))

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(vcd)
```
</details>


Now we should read in the data. Save the csv file to your computer and read it in. For convenience, we will all store it as an object named `lol_genders`.


<details>
<summary><b>Click to reveal code</b></summary>

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false


# You might need to change the file path to match your setup.
lol_genders <- readr::read_csv("lol_gender_lanes_patch16.2.csv")
```
</details>

## Exploratory Analysis

Before attempting to conduct a formal statistical inference on these data, we will start with some numerical and graphical summaries to better understand the data.


### Univariate Analyses

We'll first investigate each of the main variables of interest (`gender` and `lane`) to familiarize ourselves with them.


- Start by make a table that displays the number of champions associated with each gender.

> Question: How many champions are included in this table? How many rows are there in the `lol_genders` dataset?

> Question: What might be happening?

Before continuing, lets remove these two champions that don't have an assigned gender. 

If you are curious which champions they are, run the following code.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false


lol_genders |>
  filter(is.na(gender))
```


To remove them we can use the `drop_na` function from the `tidyr` package.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false


lol_MFonly <- lol_genders |> drop_na(gender)
```

Now, we'll investigate the the `lane` variable. Be sure to use the trimmed dataset that excluded the champions that didn't have genders assigned to them.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false


table(lol_MFonly$lane)
```

### Bivariate Analysis

- Two-ways tables

- Bar charts

- Mosaic Plots

## Inferential Statistics

### Overview of Chi-Square Test

Give big picture of chi-square test. Maybe outline the steps and then give the details?

### Hypotheses

### Computing the Chi-square test statistic and p-value

### Interpreting Results

- Report and interpret an effect size for association (e.g., Cramér's V).

- Use residuals / cell contributions to identify which category combinations drive the association.

### Extensions?

- Simulated p-value
- Other ways to interpret results
- Other variables? (maybe the genre?)
- Other games?



## Optional: Instructor Materials for Introductory Statistics Courses
