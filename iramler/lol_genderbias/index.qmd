### Introduction

League of Legends (LoL) is a 5 v. 5 multiplayer online battle arena
(MOBA) game developed by Riot Games. In this game, players assume the
role of a "champion" with unique abilities and engage in intense battles
against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions.

In standard play on Summoner's Rift, champions are typically assigned to
roles that correspond to different lanes/positions on the map—most
commonly Top, Jungle, Mid, Bottom (AD Carry), and Support (see
@fig-srmap). Champions assigned to each position have distinct strategic
responsibilities (for example, the Jungler moves between lanes to secure
objectives, while the Support focuses on protecting and enabling
teammates). Champions also have narrative identities that include
attributes such as gender, and players often choose champions based on a
mix of gameplay fit (role/position) and character preference.

![Lanes in Summoner's Rift](sr_map.png){#fig-srmap}

In this module, we will investigate whether the distribution of genders
differs across roles.

The majority of the champion metadata for this module comes from
[LoLdleData](https://github.com/Kerrders/LoLdleData){target="_blank"},
an open GitHub project that programmatically compiles "extra" champion
attributes that aren't conveniently available from the official Riot API
endpoints (e.g., gender, game lore region, and release year).

The LoLdleData is supplemented with laning information taken from the
fan-site [Mobalytics](https://mobalytics.gg/lol){target="_blank"} (based
on patch 16.2).

Because these are community-maintained, derived datasets, the gender and
lane labels should be treated as typical classifications rather than
official ground truth. In particular, lane/role assignments reflect a
snapshot based on patch 16.2, and many champions can be played
effectively in multiple lanes depending on strategy, player skill, and
balance changes.

By the end of this tutorial, students will be able to:

1.  Organize two categorical variables into a contingency table and
    compute row/column proportions.

2.  Create and interpret exploratory visualizations for two categorical
    variables (e.g., side-by-side bars, stacked proportion bars, mosaic
    plots).

3.  State hypotheses for the Chi-square test of association and explain
    what "independence" means in this context.

4.  Compute and interpret the Chi-square test statistic, degrees of
    freedom, and p-value using R.

5.  Check chi-square conditions by examining expected cell counts.

6.  Report and interpret an effect size for association.

7.  Use residuals / cell contributions to identify which category
    combinations drive the association.

**Technology Requirement:**

This activity is designed to be completed primarily in `R` using a
Quarto document workflow. Students should be comfortable importing data
and performing basic data wrangling with packages from the tidyverse
(especially `readr`, `dplyr`, and `tidyr`).

Statistical inference will be carried out using base R functions such as
`chisq.test()`.

We will also use the `vcd` package (Visualizing Categorical Data) to
create mosaic and association plots, including optional residual-based
shading that helps identify which category combinations contribute most
to the chi-square result.

<summary><b>Instructor’s Note (Optional: Point-and-Click
Software)</b></summary>

A short optional section provides guidance for completing the chi-square
test in a point-and-click environment (e.g., Minitab) for instructors
that do not use `R`.

### Data

The `lol_gender_lanes_patch16.2.csv` dataset contains 172 rows, one per
League of Legends champion, and includes basic metadata used to study
the relationship between **champion gender** and **typical lane/role**
(based on patch 16.2). Several metadata fields are included for context
and potential extensions, but the primary variables for this module are
`gender` and `lane`.

## Analyzing Associations between Categorical Variables

### Motivating question

In this module, we investigate the following research question:

> **Is champion gender associated with typical lane/role in League of Legends?**  
> In other words, **does the distribution of champion genders differ across the five Summoner’s Rift roles** (Top, Jungle, Mid, Bottom/AD Carry, Support)?



::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Conclusion" appearance="minimal"}
Through this module, you explored how physical attributes, specifically
wingspan and wingspan advantage might relate to on-court performance in
the NBA. By cleaning the combining data from multiple sources, you've
created a comprehensive dataset that allowed for deeper exploration of
relationships between physical characteristics and basketball
statistics.

With your final combined dataset, you were able to generate
visualizations to investigate potential connections, such as whether
players with longer wingspan advantages tend to have a larger defensive
impact. These kinds of relationships can provide use insights for
analysts, scouts and even fans trying to understand the value of certain
physical traits.

This activity underscores the value of data wrangling, merging and
visualization and sets the stage for more advanced analysis in the
future. Whether that's building predictive models, exploring important
relationships, or applying machine learning techniques to sports data.
